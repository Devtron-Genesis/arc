      <h2>2. INFORMATION ABOUT US</h2><br>
      <p>Marketing Hook Limited company number 10176093 registered office Holly Bank Industrial Estate Manchester M26 3SY operates ARC.
      </p><br>

      <h2>3. WHAT WE DO</h2><br>
      <p>We operate the Platform, in accordance with these Terms, which allows you to easily join, set up, collect and manage reward (“Rewards”) and redeem such Rewards as credit to offset against or apply towards your mobile phone bill (whether pre-paid or monthly). <br><br>
        You are able to collect Rewards in accordance with these Terms simply by downloading the mobile applications we notify you of onto your iOS or Android smartphones provided that you complete a review. To complete a review, you must leave your star rating for the relevant app at the iTunes store or the Google Play store (as appropriate). You may also leave text commentary with your star rating but this is not required to qualify for Rewards. <br><br>
        Please note that if you previously downloaded the relevant app(s) you are ineligible to qualify for Rewards in respect of such mobile app(s). Further the mechanism for confirming that your review is linked to the Application is outside of our Platform and although we monitor the same we are not liable for problems which occur beyond our reasonable control. <br><br>
        Once you have collected sufficient Rewards you may redeem those Rewards as rewards (“Airtime Rewards”) which allow you to use credit to offset against your applicable, or your applicable chosen, mobile phone bill or obtain credits to be used to purchase pre-paid vouchers for your applicable phone, or your applicable chosen phone. In each case, your mobile phone operator (“Network Provider”) must be a supported network on our Platform.<br><br>
      </p><br>

      <h2>4. REGISTRATION</h2><br>

        In order to access the features of the Platform, you must firstly register with us and set up an account with a valid phone number and pin code (an “Account”). To create an Account, you must be 18 or over and capable, under English Law, of entering into this Agreement.

      </p><br>

      <h2>7. EARNING REWARDS</h2><br>
      <p>Whenever we notify you of new apps available to review we will show you how many Rewards you will earn for completing the relevant review. We show the “£” prefix to indicate the value of the Airtime Rewards which will be accrued when you redeem those Rewards.<br><br>
        We advise that you use an appropriate wifi service to download the nominated apps rather than using the data allowance with your Network Operator.<br><br>
        You may not combine or transfer rewards with other persons and any trading of rewards (including but not limited to selling for money and/or other goods and/or other services) via any method will result in your (and any other user included) disqualification from the Platform and forfeiture of all rewards  in your (and their) account.<br><br>
        We reserve the right to change, add or remove the methods by which users can earn rewards and earn and redeem Airtime Rewards, for any reason and without notice to you, in our sole discretion and at any time.<br><br>

        If you believe that Rewards and/or Airtime Rewards were not properly accrued to your Account, please notify us by using the “Contact Us” form on our website/Application within 30 days of when you think the error occurred. Please allow 30 days for any claims to be researched and corrected as needed. Our determination will be final. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that Rewards and/or Airtime Rewards you believe should have been accrued can be credited to you later, if we cannot determine the action you took on the Application. Among other reasons, technical problems with verification of transaction information may result in your action not being detected or verified accurately by the Application. While we try to prevent that from happening, we will not be held liable for your inability to accrue Rewards and/or Airtime Rewards in such event. </p><br>



        <h2>8. REDEEMING AIRTIME</h2><br>
        <p>You can select any credit package or bundle package available at that time for which you have accumulated sufficient Rewards for redemption. To redeem, click the redeem credit button follow instructions provided to claim the Airtime Reward. For some Airtime Rewards all you need to do is select the applicable package to apply it to your Account, which in turn will then be seen as a credit on your mobile phone bill (you will see ‘Marketing Hook Limited’ or ‘Airtime Rewards’ as the provider of a ‘credit’ on your phone bill) with your applicable Network Provider (depending on the actual date of redemption this may be seen as being redeemed against your current month’s bill or the following months bill). Other Airtime Rewards (for example where such Airtime Reward is to be applied as a “pre-pay top-up”) you will receive an SMS with specific details on how to claim (with applicable instructions and time limits imposed). For each “pre-pay top-up” Airtime Reward you will be given a unique code which is issued by the applicable Network Provider to us, and once you have applied the sufficient number of rewards to claim the specific Airtime Reward (listed in the Rewards section of the Application), we will provide you with the unique code and we are not responsible or liable for its value or the process as the Network Provider is in the position to supply and accept the unique codes. The application of an Airtime Reward is carried out directly by us. We apply the Airtime Reward with the specific Network Provider selected, which in usual circumstances should be completed within 24 hours, however, we shall not be liable for any delay in such completion as (and as detailed previously in these Terms), technology can present faults, issues and delays. Any communication which is detailed as being necessary to being sent to or applied to a particular phone number will be to the phone number provided. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your contact information in your Account. We reserve the right to modify the values and number of Rewards required for redemption of the Airtime Rewards at any time for any reason. We are not the supplier of the Airtime Rewards, but any issue which you may have with the Airtime Rewards or the redemption process should be made in the first instance to us at hello@app-review.club We will not however be responsible for the actions of the Network Providers in their administration and/or acceptance of the unique codes. <br><br>
          Subject to reaching the applicable level, rewards can be redeemed as soon as they are reflected in your Account balance or may be accrued over time for later use prior to expiration or forfeiture, or termination of the Platform. Rewards are not your property and have no cash value whatsoever and may only be redeemed for Airtime Rewards offered on the Platform. Rewards cannot be sold, transferred, or assigned. Rewards may be revoked at any time by us in accordance with these Terms. All redemptions of Airtime Rewards are final. Once you have applied a particular Airtime Reward in accordance with these Terms (and always in accordance with applicable laws) you shall not be able to claim any refund, exchange and other issue regarding the redeemed Airtime Reward. Restrictions may apply to certain Network Providers participating on the Application are subject to change at any time. You are responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes that may result from Airtime Rewards received as part of the Platform. <br><br>
          In the event that the value of your Airtime Rewards exceeds your debit balance with your Network Operator then (subject to that Network Operator’s terms with you) the balance will be held over as a credit balance on your account with them.<br><br>
          All Airtime Rewards are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
        </p><br>

        <h2>9. NETWORK PROVIDERS</h2><br>
        <p>We are proud to offer an impressive number of Network Providers who are supported on our Platform, and these will be displayed in full detail on our Application at the [‘Supported] Networks’ area. <br><br>
          You will only be able to use the Application and associated Services if your Network Provider is supported on our Platform. We will check this on registration (as per below) and each time you use the Application, and we will not be liable in any way in the event that your Network Provider is not supported on our Application at registration.<br><br>
          When you register your Account we will attempt to validate your mobile number and Network Provider using all the applicable information available to us and collected in accordance with these Terms (including in this case, information provided from your SIM card and/or directly from your Network Provider). In order to deliver the best possible service we continue to monitor and verify such information in order to determine and assess whether your Network Provider is still supported.<br><br>
          Change of Network Provider: the collection of Rewards is personal to you and is done so with a valid UK phone number. We do however recognise that you may from time to time wish to change Network Provider and enable redemption of Airtime Rewards with your new Network Provider. We do allow you to change your Network Provider via our Application provided that such Network Provider is supported on our Platform. In the event that your Network Provider is supported on our Platform you will be able to apply such Rewards which you have already earned against your new Network Provider once you have confirmed the new Network Provider. In the event that your new Network Provider is not supported on our Platform then you will be unable to use the Application and associated Services in accordance with these Terms. We accept no responsibility for any choice which you make in choosing a Network Provider, and we accept no responsibility for any losses which you may experience as a result of changing Network Providers. You may be able, in the event of you choosing an unsupported Network Provider, to apply your Airtime Rewards to another person in accordance with these Terms.  <br><br>
          We have agreements with all of the Network Providers to apply Airtime Rewards as credits to your Account. These credits may in respect of some Network Operators be subject to periodic limits and you are not able to breach these limits imposed on you either by us or via us by the Network Provider. The Application will enforce the limits when you come to redeem an Airtime Reward.</p><br>

          <h2>10. SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENT</h2><br>
          <p>The use of the Services and the Application is currently made available to users in consideration of a subscription payment (“Subscription”). The cost and frequency of the Subscription is set-out in our marketing material and Application itself. The Subscription payment is debited to the UK mobile phone you have nominated and we collect the Subscription from your Network Operator.<br><br>
            Before billing you for each Subscription we will send you a message letting you know and telling you how to stop your Subscription. <br><br>
            In the event that you terminate your Subscription, or payment for it is not honoured, all your accrued Rewards will be forfeited and will no longer be capable of redemption for Airtime Rewards.
          </p><br>

          </p>

          <h2>24. SEVERABILITY</h2><br>
